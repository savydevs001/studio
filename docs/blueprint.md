- Accent color: A deeper, contrasting blue (#528AAE) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.  In HSL, this is approximately (203, 40%, 47%).
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for both headings and body text, providing a modern and neutral look.
- Use a card-based layout for each section of the appraisal form to present the information in an organized manner as shown in the example, making it easy to focus on one area at a time.
- Incorporate simple, intuitive icons for visual cues. Use icons to represent different vehicle parts and conditions in addition to their text descriptions.
- Use subtle animations when transitioning between different form sections.
